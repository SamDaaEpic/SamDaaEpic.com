## The Beginning

When I was like 11 the first time I was Introduced to Linux was by a Android App called Termux. Back then I didn't have acess to any Computer or Laptop and since i didn't have any PC, I was those types kids who wanted to play good graphics games like GTA V and stuff on their Phones. So as any wise kid would do, i watched thousands of fake tutorials on how to run Windows 10 on my phone so I could run GTA V, and then I stumbled upon a video which showed how to run a lighter version of Windows 10 using qemu in termux. At that time I didn't knew anything about qemu neither termux or linux, so I watched the tutorial and copy pasted some commands, at the end I got it to work but only a sluggish version Windows 10 and not even able to open a chrome tab. But all I know is 


__That Was A Beginning To Something Big__.

## Running Actual Linux

Now, Since I got a bit familiar with linux. Now instead of running Linux on Android Phones and Stuff using a Emulator, I wanted to run it Natively. And After some Deep Research I found out that you could run Linux Natively on Android Tv Boxes by booting them from a SD-Card. Since I already had a cheep little Android Tv Box in my home I Tinkered around with it As Much As I could. And finally after around 3 or 4 Weeks of tinkering I got it to work. I flashed Armbian from balbes150 and it worked. And you probably know what happened after that?? Dont you??? I tinkerd more and more and digged deeper into the rabbit hole. I even created my own image files to run Kali Linux And Arch Linux On Android Tv Boxes (I Uploaded them on some Cloud Storage Service But i Couldnt remeber the website neither the password, Since it was too long ago). That Basically how i got a bit deeper into the Rabbit Hole Of Linux.

## Creating My First Linux Server

Since i got Linux running on my Android Tv Box Natively. I thought it would be good to give it some puprose to exist. That was the time when i learned Docker And got into the Server Realm of Linux. I learned docker and created a HomeLab Using my Android Tv Box. It had Pihole, Jellyfin, qBittorent, etc. And By doing that I also learned Alot about linux. And now literally everyone in my House Uses Jellyfin Haha....

## Getting My First Computer

I have already Learned a lot about linux even without a computer just by using a Android Tv Box And a Phone. When i was around 13-14 I got my first laptop which was a old second hand Macbook Pro 2008 Model. And as you probably already guessed I installed Linux on it. And As Time Went on i learned more and more about and linux, i started out with manjaro then switched to Arch Linux and you cant even imagine how much i Distro Hopped and finally settled on Arch Linux. I learned a lot about linux and thats from where i got into Programming too. Thats basically Entire Linux Journey
